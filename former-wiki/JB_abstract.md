One challenge in NMR has always been to reduce the acquired data to
essential values. These values spread from single quantification values
that estimate the purity of a compound, a yes/no answer for a compound
identity or collection of values that reflect the complexity of a sample
or the structure of a compound. How we share NMR data (when we do) and
the way we share those values does not show the true capabilities of
this technique. Several methods developed early on by the NMR pioneers
are coming back and start to be perceived as valuable. In this
presentation, we will wander along the path of quantum-mechanics based
simulations and bifurcate to quantitative NMR and look at what these can
offer to NMR users. We will further examine the challenges raised by the
current software solutions and how we could surmount them.
