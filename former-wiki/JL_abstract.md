LOGS (Lab Organisation Group Site) is a local data repository allowing
scientists to achieve FAIRness within their workgroups, starting with
the measurement and data generation. After its acquisition, data is
uploaded automatically from the instrument and available metadata
recognized and stored in a database by parsing the dataset files.
Further metadata can be added by manual addition and by linking to
existing LOGS content. Filter and search functionality, as well as
access and display via the web browser, give group scientists a
transparent view of the data. NMReData is a natural fit for LOGS:
Information contained in NMReData format will be made visible and
searchable to the users within the LOGS spectrumviewer, and an export
function will allow its users to generate and export data imported via
formats other than NMReData into this FAIR and open format.
