At St. Olaf College, we have developed a web-based fully automated
Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with a 120-position BACS sample changer
that serves both research and teaching lab users from a simple web
interface (https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/nmr/). The system allows for 24/7
accessibility for novices and experts alike. In this presentation I will
give a brief overview of the system, illustrating how it has completely
changed our approach to teaching about NMR spectroscopy in the organic
lab. Recent advances in the system will be highlighted, including the
ability to do real-time structure/spectrum comparison using drawing- or
name/identifier-based simulation.
