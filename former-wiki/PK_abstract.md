NMReData and NMR Records are data formats that simplify the publishing,
exchange, and archival of associated NMR spectra. Probably the most
important advantage of digital formats is the data consistency, which is
not given when using old "analog" publishing methods.

We will introduce the NMReData converter implemented in the Bruker
software which is free for academic customers. Possible synergies with
other data formats will be also discussed.
