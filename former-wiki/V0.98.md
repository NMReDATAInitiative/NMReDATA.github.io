Comments and changes to version 0.98
====================================

Renaming the SDF tag "NMREDATA_SIGNALS" into "NMREDATA_ASSIGNMENT"
------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to avoid confusiont between signal in 1D and 2D spectra with
the individual resonance we called "ASSIGNMENT" the tag listing the
correlations between the individual signals and the list of atoms. The
tag including the assignment was renamed NMREDATA_ASSIGNMENT (early name
: NMREDATA_SIGNALS) to avoid confusion with the signals in the spectra.

Intensity of signals in 2D spectra
----------------------------------

Concerning the intensity in 2D spectra, it was not a good idea to ask to
strictly give the intensity at the coordinates of the peak. This may
fall in the middle of a doublet (in a HSQC for example). So this was
slightly rephrased in this version

For all 2D spectra, the intensity of the spectrum at (or very close to)
the coordinates of the correlated peaks should be given when the
spectrum is available. If the signals has a shape such that the
intensity is zero at that center (phase sensitive COSY, for in the
middle of a well resolved doublet in HSQC, for example) the intensity
can be measure at the maximum amplitude of the multiplet. This intensity
is not pretending to be “quantitative”. Optional integration of the
volume is possible using the "E=" attribute.
