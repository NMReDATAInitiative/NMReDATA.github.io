-   Create a folder in which you will include a set folder (see below)
    including all the supplementary data.

<!-- -->

-   For each Figure, each Scheme and each Table of the article (and the
    supplementary information), include in a folder the file(s) used for
    their preparation.

Examples:

`/Figure_1/main_reaction.cdx`
`/Table_1/irradiation_conditions.xls`

-   For each compound for which you have spectra (NMR, IR, etc.), create
    a folder named according to the compound number in the paper and
    include:
    -   1\) a structure file (typically a .cdx file of the structure of
        the compound).
    -   2\) all the files of the different spectra you have (crude NMR
        in the spectrometer's format, .mnova, jcamp, etc. files of all
        analytical technique you used - whether they are reported in the
        paper/supp. Information or not...

Examples:

`Compound_1/starting_product.cdx`

`Compound_2/final_product.cdx`
`Compound_2/NMR/St332_1/10/... (1D 1H spectrum)`
`Compound_2/NMR/St332_1/11/... (1D 13C spectrum)`
`Compound_2/NMR/St332_1/12/... (2D HSQC) `
`Compound_2/IR/st322.jcamp `
`Compound_2/EA/exact_mass.txt`

-   Compress the main folder in the form of a .zip file.
-   Upload the zip file when submitting your article.

If the file is too large for the upload or if are worried that the
Publisher will not make you supplementary data available for free to all
reader, you can use a (free) service such as Zenodo or Figshare, etc.
You can impose an embargo to the record. When the article is accepted,
you simply click to make the data public. In the mean time and the
service can generate a special hashed link that you paste in the article
so that only reviewers can access the data. These service also generates
a (permanent) doi which can be included in the body of the text so that
readers can access them directly. This requires no action on the side of
the editor of the journal.

PS. An option is to rename the folder numbers (10, 11, 12 in the file
structure above) into 1D_1H, 1D_13C, HSQC, to facilitate the reviewer's
work.
