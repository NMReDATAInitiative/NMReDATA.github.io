The discovery of natural organic compounds and the preparation of new
synthetic ones require the rigorous description of molecular structures
based on spectroscopic methods, among which NMR plays an important role.
The simultaneous reporting of structures and of interpreted spectra
descriptions motivated the design of the NMReDATA file format. The
coherence of the information contained in an NMReDATA file is a
necessity and the validation of a structure can be carried out by the
search of alternative ones from spectra descriptions using
Computer-Assited Structure Elucidation (CASE). This talk presents three
cases of various complexity in which the CASE LSD software contributed
to NMReDATA file validation.
