Recently, awareness of the need for improved data handling has reached
chemistry. For NMR spectroscopy, the most important and ubiquitous
technique for chemists to derive structural information, this means at
the same time a chance and a challenge: The base of future skills for
chemists is laid at academic institutions, where chemists in the
laboratory and at the spectrometer need to find an suitable and state of
the art way of teaching the method and its applications in the digital
age. Experiences from everyday life of NMR teaching at a university will
be presented and may deliver some thought-provoking impulses for
discussion.
