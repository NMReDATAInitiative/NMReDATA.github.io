Mnova meets NMReData: automation workflows and new opportunities

Historically, chemists used (and it's still a common practice) to report
NMR spectra in scientific articles as a list of multiplets, with or
without assignments or in a tabular form in which, in addition to
assigned chemical shifts, 2D correlations can also be included.

Whilst this practice could be justified years ago, itâ€™s totally
unacceptable in this digital era. NMR data in such restricted format
hugely difficults fraud detection and, even most importantly, prevents
other scientists from extracting maximum benefit from the research
investments. This includes the inability of machines to automatically
find and use the published NMR data in a convenient way.

NMReData has emerged as a response to those (and other) limitations
presenting itself as a simple, yet comprehensive NMR assignments data
archival format which seeks to adhere to the FAIR principles and
therefore enhancing the reusability of the published data.

Here we show the NMReData converters implemented in Mnova, which cover
both importing and exporting of NMR data. Together with implementation
details, we will discuss practical applications, including batch
conversion of legacy data, cleaning up of misassignments and automatic
creation of predictive models based on NMReData.
